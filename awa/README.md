# awa

Postgres-native background job queue. Transactional enqueue, heartbeat
crash recovery, priority aging, retries with backoff, cron, callbacks,
unique jobs, dead-letter queue, and a vacuum-aware storage engine
designed to keep dead-tuple pressure bounded under sustained load.

This crate is the user-facing facade. It re-exports the worker
(`awa-worker`) and model (`awa-model`) crates and is what most Rust
applications depend on directly.

```toml
[dependencies]
awa = "0.6"
```

## Quick start

```rust
use awa::{Client, JobArgs, JobContext, JobResult, QueueConfig};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, JobArgs)]
struct SendEmail {
    to: String,
    subject: String,
}

async fn send_email(ctx: JobContext<SendEmail>) -> JobResult {
    println!("sending to {}: {}", ctx.args.to, ctx.args.subject);
    Ok(())
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let pool = sqlx::PgPool::connect(&std::env::var("DATABASE_URL")?).await?;
    let client = Client::builder(pool.clone())
        .queue("email", QueueConfig::default())
        .register_handler::<SendEmail, _, _>(send_email)
        .build()
        .await?;

    client.enqueue(SendEmail {
        to: "ada@example.com".into(),
        subject: "hello".into(),
    }).await?;

    client.start().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## What you get

- **Transactional enqueue** — enqueueing a job is a normal `INSERT` you can
  commit alongside your application's writes.
- **Vacuum-aware storage** — append-only ready/terminal partitions plus
  rotating lease and receipt rings keep the hot queue tables' dead-tuple
  footprint bounded under sustained load. See [ADR-019](../docs/adr/019-queue-storage-redesign.md)
  and [ADR-023](../docs/adr/023-receipt-plane-ring-partitioning.md).
- **Crash-safe execution** — heartbeat-based lease tracking; jobs whose
  workers vanish are rescued automatically.
- **Per-queue policy** — priorities, priority aging, weighted concurrency,
  rate limits, deadlines, retry/backoff, cron, dead-letter queue.
- **Unique jobs** — content-keyed deduplication windowed across pending /
  running / completed.
- **Callbacks and external waits** — wait for an external event without
  burning a worker slot.
- **First-class Python bindings** — same engine, same SQL, same defaults;
