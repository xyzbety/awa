# ADR-008: Batch COPY Ingestion

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The PRD (section 18) calls for a high-throughput insert path using PostgreSQL's
COPY protocol. The existing `insert_many` uses multi-row `INSERT` statements
with parameterized queries, which is limited by PostgreSQL's 65,535 parameter
limit (requiring chunking at roughly 5,950 rows with 11 params per row) and
the overhead of query planning per statement.

The original COPY design predated later architectural changes:

- hot and deferred jobs now live in separate physical tables
- `awa.jobs` is a compatibility view rather than the main hot-path heap
- uniqueness is enforced through `awa.job_unique_claims`
- callers may invoke COPY multiple times inside one outer transaction
- ADR-019 queue storage writes producer hot-path rows into
  `{schema}.ready_entries` and scheduled rows into `{schema}.deferred_jobs`

## Decision

Maintain the existing compatibility COPY path as a staging-table approach:

1. Create or reuse a session-local temp table in `pg_temp` with
   `ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS`
2. `COPY` CSV-encoded rows into that staging table
3. Route staged rows through the compatibility insert path, which preserves
   hot/deferred routing and uniqueness semantics for the active storage backend
4. For non-unique batches, use one `INSERT ... SELECT ... RETURNING *` from
   staging into the chosen target table
5. For batches containing unique jobs, read staged rows back and insert them
   one at a time under savepoints, skipping `23505` uniqueness conflicts
6. Explicitly clear staged rows after use so multiple COPY calls can happen
   safely inside the same outer transaction

For queue storage producers, add a direct COPY path:

1. Prepare `InsertParams` with the same code as `enqueue_params_batch`
2. Apply queue striping, allocate job ids, reserve per-lane sequence ranges,
   sync uniqueness claims in one statement for new enqueues, and update lane
   counters inside one transaction
3. Stream available jobs into
   `{schema}.ready_entries (ready_slot, ready_generation, job_id, kind, queue,
   args, priority, attempt, run_lease, max_attempts, lane_seq, run_at,
   attempted_at, created_at, unique_key, unique_states, payload)`
4. Stream scheduled jobs into
   `{schema}.deferred_jobs (job_id, kind, queue, args, state, priority,
   attempt, run_lease, max_attempts, run_at, attempted_at, finalized_at,
   created_at, unique_key, unique_states, payload)`
5. Notify logical queues after ready rows have been copied, matching
   `enqueue_params_batch`

### Why staging table instead of direct COPY into `awa.jobs`

- The staging table has no constraints, no indexes, and no Awa triggers, so
  the COPY phase stays simple and fast
- The final insert still goes through Awa's real insert semantics, including
  hot/deferred routing and enqueue side effects
- The compatibility `awa.jobs` surface is a view, so direct COPY into it is
  not a practical general solution
- Reusing a session-local temp table avoids repeated catalog churn under
  concurrent producers
- `ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS` still gives transactional cleanup on
  commit/rollback

### API signatures

```rust
pub async fn insert_many_copy(conn: &mut PgConnection, jobs: &[InsertParams]) -> Result<Vec<JobRow>, AwaError>
pub async fn insert_many_copy_from_pool(pool: &PgPool, jobs: &[InsertParams]) -> Result<Vec<JobRow>, AwaError>
impl QueueStorage {
    pub async fn enqueue_params_copy(&self, pool: &PgPool, jobs: &[InsertParams]) -> Result<usize, AwaError>
}
```

Accepting `&mut PgConnection` allows callers to use COPY within a broader
transaction (Transaction derefs to PgConnection in sqlx 0.8).
`QueueStorage::enqueue_params_copy` takes a pool because it needs one
transaction that combines sequence allocation, lane reservation, uniqueness
claim sync, direct COPY into queue-storage tables, lane-counter updates, and
queue notification.

### CSV serialization

Custom CSV serialization handles escaping and null encoding for:

- JSONB fields (JSON text, CSV-quoted)
- `TEXT[]` arrays (Postgres `{...}` literal, CSV-quoted)
- `BYTEA` (`\\x...` hex format)
- `TIMESTAMPTZ` (RFC 3339, or the COPY null sentinel)
- `BIT(8)` (text bit string)

### NOTIFY trigger impact

The enqueue notify trigger fires when the final insert reaches the hot table.
This is acceptable: PostgreSQL coalesces notifications within a transaction,
and dispatchers handle duplicates gracefully.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **No parameter limit:** COPY path bypasses the 65,535 parameter limit entirely.
- **Reusable staging path:** Session-local staging avoids repeated temp-table
  create/drop churn under contention.
- **Shared internals:** `PreparedRow` / `precompute_rows` are reused between
  `insert_many` and `insert_many_copy`; queue-storage COPY reuses
  `prepare_row_raw` and the queue-storage enqueue pipeline.
- **Direct queue-storage producer:** queue storage can bypass the
  compatibility view/function and COPY directly into `ready_entries` and
  `deferred_jobs` while preserving job id, lane, counter, uniqueness, and
  notification invariants.
- **Batched queue-storage uniqueness:** direct queue-storage producers batch
  enqueue-time uniqueness claims with one `unnest(bytea[], bigint[])` driven
  `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` statement. Duplicate keys inside the request are
  rejected before COPY; conflicts against existing claims abort the transaction
  before any ready/deferred rows are copied.
- **Python support:** Python bindings expose `insert_many_copy` /
  `insert_many_copy_sync` for compatibility COPY and `enqueue_many_copy` /
  `enqueue_many_copy_sync` for direct queue-storage COPY.

### Negative

- **CSV serialization complexity:** Custom CSV encoding for JSONB, `TEXT[]`,
  `BYTEA`, and `TIMESTAMPTZ` requires careful escaping and adds a non-trivial
  code path to maintain.
- **Split unique path:** Unique jobs do not use one bulk `ON CONFLICT` path
  anymore; they fall back to savepoint-guarded row inserts after staging.
- **Staging overhead remains:** COPY still pays for staging and a final insert
  into the real Awa tables, so it is not automatically faster than chunked
  multi-row `INSERT` in every workload.
- **Lane cursors remain online:** queue-storage enqueue still bumps
  `queue_enqueue_heads.next_seq` once per touched lane and
  transaction. Earlier iterations also maintained a
  `queue_lanes.available_count` cache on the same path; that cache
  has been dropped (see [ADR-019](019-queue-storage-redesign.md) §
  `lane_state` and segment cursor tables) and the dispatcher now
  derives availability from the head-table difference, so the only
  remaining hot-lane write on the enqueue path is the cursor bump.

## Relationship to ADR-019

ADR-019 supersedes the hot/deferred physical layout as Awa's primary storage
engine. The staging-table decision in this ADR still stands for
compatibility-surface COPY (`insert_many_copy`). Queue-storage producers use
`QueueStorage::enqueue_params_copy` to COPY directly into
`{schema}.ready_entries` and `{schema}.deferred_jobs` after preparing all
derived state in Rust and SQL. References in this ADR to `awa.jobs_hot` /
`awa.scheduled_jobs` describe the canonical compatibility path, not the
queue-storage hot path; see [ADR-019](019-queue-storage-redesign.md).
