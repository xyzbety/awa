# ADR-023 Completion Write-Amplification Follow-Up (2026-05-02)

This note records a focused completion-path follow-up to
[ADR-023](../023-receipt-plane-ring-partitioning.md). The experiment
targeted three costs visible in the portable harness:

- terminal write amplification for default successful completions
- round trips inside receipt-backed completion transactions
- partition locality for closure and terminal writes

## Changes Tested

- Keep `done_entries.payload` `NULL` when the terminal runtime payload is
  empty or unchanged from the corresponding ready row.
- Skip the ready-payload lookup entirely when every row in a done batch
  has an empty terminal payload.
- Merge receipt closure insertion and `attempt_state` cleanup into one
  data-modifying CTE.
- Sort completion batches by `claim_slot`, then `(job_id, run_lease)`,
  before dispatching them to queue storage.

The changes preserve ADR-023's correctness shape: receipt-backed
completion still closes the exact `(claim_slot, job_id, run_lease)` claim
and stale writers still lose via the closure conflict / materialized
lease fallback. The default successful path still appends a
`done_entries` row, so terminal history, retention, and queue-count
semantics do not change.

## Focused Harness Runs

All runs used the extracted portable harness from
`hardbyte/postgresql-job-queue-benchmarking` with:

```text
PRODUCER_BATCH_MAX=128 PRODUCER_BATCH_MS=25 \
uv run bench run --systems awa --producer-rate 5000 --worker-count 64 \
  --phase warmup=warmup:10s --phase clean=clean:75s --sample-every 5
```

The earlier comparison run used the same Awa adapter settings as part of
an `awa,pgque` comparison. Systems are run independently with a fresh
Postgres container, so the Awa phase is comparable for a directional
signal.

| run id | median completion/s | peak completion/s | median backlog | peak backlog | median e2e p99 |
|--------|---------------------:|------------------:|---------------:|-------------:|---------------:|
| `custom-20260502T022357Z-14b91e` | 3,251 | 4,002 | 57,005 | 116,812 | 11.6 s |
| `custom-20260502T024341Z-674839` | 4,272 | 5,204 | 7,315 | 28,098 | 2.0 s |
| `custom-20260502T024606Z-6a2d02` | 4,621 | 5,861 | 3,780 | 31,988 | 1.9 s |

The patched repeats were both above the comparison run by 31-42% on
median completion throughput. The backlog and end-to-end p99 reductions
are larger because the producer target was 5,000/s: once completion gets
closer to the offered rate, the queue stops running away during the
short clean phase.

## Wait Profile

The wait profile did not move to relation or transaction locks. It
remained dominated by CPU, `WALWriteLock`, `ClientRead`, and `WalSync`,
which matches the write-amplification model from issue #207: fewer
completion statements and less terminal payload work improve throughput,
but the binding resource is still the WAL/fsync plane.

## Not Shipped In This Follow-Up

A narrower default-success receipt instead of a full `done_entries` row
is still plausible, but it is a schema/API contract change rather than a
local hot-path optimization. To make it viable, the success receipt would
need enough information for:

- queue counts after ready partitions rotate
- terminal retention and pruning
- `load_job` / admin inspection of completed jobs
- retry/replay tooling that expects terminal job identity and timing

Until that shape is designed, `done_entries` remains the materialized
terminal record and the safe optimization is to keep its unchanged
payload column `NULL`.
