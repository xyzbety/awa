# ADR-023: Receipt Plane Ring Partitioning

## Status

Accepted (implemented). `lease_claim_receipts` is the default in 0.6.
The validation artifact under `docs/adr/bench/` is the empirical
evidence the design holds; this ADR is the architectural record.

## Context

ADR-019 committed the queue storage engine to a vacuum-aware discipline:
every hot table reclaims space by partition rotation and `TRUNCATE`, not by
row-level `DELETE` or `UPDATE` churn. Queue entries, terminal entries, active
leases, deferred jobs, and DLQ entries all follow that contract. The ADR-019
validation artifact recorded 276 exact dead tuples across the entire schema
after a 1000/s soak — `queue_lanes=19, ready=0, done=255, leases=2,
attempt_state=0` — consistent with the design intent.

The experimental receipt-backed short-job path introduced after that
validation adds three tables:

- `lease_claims` — append-only claim receipts (durable claim history)
- `lease_claim_closures` — append-only closure tombstones
- `open_receipt_claims` — a bounded "currently live receipt-backed attempt"
  frontier, introduced so rescue and queue-count queries would not degrade
  into anti-joins against unbounded claim history

`lease_claims` and `lease_claim_closures` honour the ADR-019 contract:
they are insert-only. `open_receipt_claims` does not. Its design is one
`INSERT` per claim and one `DELETE` per completion, so every completion
produces a dead tuple on that table.

Measurements at the time the receipt ring landed confirmed this is the
remaining MVCC source. In an internal long-horizon run from
`custom-20260424T065828Z-227187` (since-extracted to
[postgresql-job-queue-benchmarking](https://github.com/hardbyte/postgresql-job-queue-benchmarking),
28-minute clean phase at ~800/s per replica, receipts on), the
`open_receipt_claims` heap held a median of 28,390 dead tuples and a peak
of 93,789 while every other hot table stayed under 100 dead tuples. The
autovacuum floor is `autovacuum_naptime=60s`, which is global, so per-table
thresholds do not move the median: a measured before/after run with
per-table knobs on `open_receipt_claims` left that median unchanged.
Knobs treat the symptom; they cannot remove the `DELETE` from the hot
path.

The receipt-backed short-job path is the only way to retire
per-claim mutable lease row churn on the common path, and making it the
default is a 0.6 release goal. Delivering that goal without violating
ADR-019 requires bringing `open_receipt_claims` onto the same rotation-and-
prune discipline as the rest of the engine.

## Design goals and non-goals

Guided by the 0.6 priorities from ADR-019:

- Preserve at-least-once delivery. No claim may be lost across any crash,
  restart, or partition-truncation boundary.
- Preserve stale-writer protection by `(job_id, run_lease)`. Completion
  must still lose cleanly against a rescue or cancel on the same attempt.
- Keep the claim hot path at least as fast as the current receipt path,
  not slower. The fix must reduce, not add, per-claim and per-completion
  work.
- Eliminate the remaining MVCC churn source. Steady-state dead tuples on
  the receipt plane should be zero once rotation catches up.
- Finish the vacuum-aware story before 0.6 ships; hold the quality bar
  rather than the timeline.

Non-goals:

- Do not change the heartbeat / deadline / callback-timeout rescue
  contract. Those continue to live on `attempt_state` and `active_leases`.
- Do not change the external API or the `(job_id, run_lease)` stale-writer
  guard.
- Do not introduce any new reservation or pre-start state. The archived
  [`lease-plane-redesign-spike`](../archive/0.6-storage-design/lease-plane-redesign-spike.md)
  record shows that direction has been tried and rejected repeatedly on cost
  grounds.

## Decision

Apply ADR-019's rotation-and-prune pattern to the receipt plane. Remove
`open_receipt_claims` as a distinct table.

### Physical layout

1. `lease_claims` becomes `PARTITIONED BY LIST (claim_slot)` with a small
   fixed set of child partitions (`lease_claims_0..N-1`).
2. `lease_claim_closures` becomes `PARTITIONED BY LIST (claim_slot)` with
   matching children. A closure row lives in the same `claim_slot` as its
   originating claim.
3. A new control-plane pair `claim_ring_state` and `claim_ring_slots`
   coordinates rotation, mirroring the existing `lease_ring_state` and
   `lease_ring_slots`.
4. `open_receipt_claims` is deleted. Its indexes and the schema-install
   backfill are dropped.

### Hot path

- Claim: append to the current `lease_claims` child partition. No other
  row is written on the receipt path. The claim result carries
  `claim_slot` through to the worker so the completion path can target the
  matching closure partition.
- Complete: append a closure row to the `lease_claim_closures` child
  partition for the same `claim_slot`, then append the terminal row to
  `done_entries` / `dlq_entries` / `deferred_jobs` as today.
- Neither step performs any `UPDATE` or `DELETE` on the receipt plane.
- Short-job fast path becomes strictly cheaper: one insert at claim
  (previously two) and one insert at completion (previously one insert
  and one delete).
- Completion batches are ordered by `claim_slot` before `(job_id,
  run_lease)` so a flusher presents partition-local closure rows to
  Postgres. That ordering does not change the stale-writer guard; it
  only improves locality for the append-only receipt plane.
- Default successful completions avoid writing a terminal payload copy
  when the runtime payload is empty or unchanged from `ready_entries`.
  When an entire done batch has empty terminal payloads, completion also
  skips the ready-payload lookup that would otherwise be needed to prove
  unchanged non-empty payloads can be elided.
- The receipt-backed completion SQL pipelines closure insert and
  `attempt_state` cleanup in one data-modifying CTE. The terminal row
  append remains a separate statement because it carries the public
  terminal-history contract and unique-claim synchronization.

### Open-claim queries

Every read that currently targets `open_receipt_claims` becomes a bounded
scan over the active `lease_claims` child partitions, anti-joined with the
matching `lease_claim_closures` children:

- "Is `(job_id, run_lease)` still open?" — PK lookup into active claim
  partitions, anti-join closures. Used by the completion guard and by
  `load_job` on receipt-backed attempts.
- "Scan stale receipt claims for rescue." — range scan on
  `claimed_at < cutoff` in active claim partitions, anti-join closures.
- "Count in-flight receipt-backed attempts." — count active-partition
  rows minus matching closure rows.

Active partitions are bounded by the claim-ring rotation window, which is
sized so that even worst-case throughput keeps the anti-join surface
smaller than what `open_receipt_claims` used to hold dynamically.

### Rotation and prune

- The maintenance leader owns `claim_ring_state` rotation on a cadence
  chosen to keep the active scan surface bounded. Initial target: rotate
  at the same cadence as the queue ring so claim partitions age out
  roughly in step with the ready / done partitions they reference.
- A claim-slot partition may be truncated only when every claim in it is
  either:
  - represented by a closure row in the corresponding
    `lease_claim_closures` partition, or
  - rescued through the existing receipt-rescue path immediately before
    prune takes `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` on the partition.
- Prune order mirrors `prune_oldest` and `prune_oldest_leases`:
  1. `FOR UPDATE` on `claim_ring_state`.
  2. `FOR UPDATE` on the target `claim_ring_slots` row.
  3. `SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '50ms'`.
  4. `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` on both partitions (claims and closures).
  5. Liveness recheck: rescue any still-open claims, then `TRUNCATE`.
- Partition truncation never races with claim because claim always writes
  to the ring's current slot and rotation advances the current slot
  atomically under the same lock order.

### Invariants preserved

- At-least-once delivery: a partition cannot truncate while live claims
  remain in it. Rescue is the gating step, not the prune itself.
- `(job_id, run_lease)` stale-writer protection: the authoritative record
  is still `lease_claims + lease_claim_closures`. Adding partitioning
  changes where those rows live, not what they mean.
- Heartbeat / deadline / callback-timeout rescue: unchanged. Those
  continue to run against `attempt_state` and `active_leases`.

### Migration

This is a breaking schema change even though the external API does not
change.

1. A new migration creates `claim_ring_state`, `claim_ring_slots`, and the
   partitioned `lease_claims` / `lease_claim_closures` shapes.
2. Existing `lease_claims` and `lease_claim_closures` rows are rewritten
   into the current slot of the new partitioned parents.
3. `open_receipt_claims` remains readable through the migration window so
   in-flight attempts are not stranded. Subsequent claim and complete
   operations target only the partitioned tables; reads on rescue and
   counts consult both sources until the window closes.
4. `open_receipt_claims` and its indexes are dropped once no schema
   revision in active use still consults it.

TLA+ coverage (`AwaSegmentedStorage`, `AwaStorageLockOrder`) is extended
to model the claim-ring rotation and the rescue-before-truncate
precondition, parallel to the existing lease-ring model.

## Validation

Success criteria for this redesign, measured on the long-horizon portable
harness used for the ADR-019 baseline:

- `open_receipt_claims` is absent from the schema. Steady-state dead
  tuples across the queue-storage schema return to the ADR-019-validation
  shape: low hundreds, concentrated in ring-state singletons.
- Throughput on the `1x32`, `4x8`, and soak profiles is no worse than the
  current branch and should improve slightly because claim and completion
  each drop a table touch.
- Crash-under-load recovers cleanly. The rescue-before-truncate path is
  exercised by the existing crash-recovery scenarios and by a new test
  that drives rescue concurrently with partition prune.
- `lease_claim_receipts` is on by default for 0.6 with no dead-tuple
  regression relative to the ADR-019 validation run.

## Consequences

### Positive

- The 0.6 vacuum-aware story becomes complete: no hot table relies on
  `DELETE` or `UPDATE` for reclamation.
- The short-job hot path drops one `INSERT` at claim and one `DELETE` at
  completion. Per-job database work is strictly reduced.
- Autovacuum tuning on `open_receipt_claims` becomes dead code and is
  removed. The per-table HOT tuning on the small ring-state and head
  tables stays because it addresses a separate per-row UPDATE class that
  this ADR does not change.
- Receipts become the default short-job path for 0.6, retiring the
  per-claim mutable lease row on the common path.

### Negative

- This is a breaking schema migration.
- "Currently open" queries move from a single bounded-frontier lookup to
  a bounded anti-join across a small number of active partitions. Query
  planning needs spot-checking once the partition count is chosen.
- Rescue gains a partition-aware variant and must run before prune takes
  `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`. The interaction point is small but adds a
  prune-path precondition not present for `ready` / `done`.
- The default-success path still appends a `done_entries` row. Replacing
  that with an even narrower success receipt would require a schema and
  admin-contract change, because queue counts, retention, `load_job`, and
  terminal inspection currently use `done_entries` as the materialized
  terminal record.

## Alternatives Considered

### Per-table autovacuum tuning on `open_receipt_claims`

Rejected. A measured 28-minute soak with aggressive per-table thresholds
and cost knobs left the median dead-tuple count on this table unchanged
relative to the unmodified baseline (`custom-20260424T041700Z-278649`
vs. `custom-20260424T065828Z-227187`). The rate-limiter is
`autovacuum_naptime=60s`, which is global, and the table is already
eligible for vacuum on every wake-up. Per-table knobs improve vacuum
efficiency when it runs but do not change the steady-state floor.

### Documented operational `autovacuum_naptime` reduction

Rejected as the primary fix. Lowering `autovacuum_naptime` globally
improves reclamation cadence but pushes configuration requirements onto
operators and applies to every table in their database. It contradicts
the ADR-019 principle that vacuum-awareness is a property of the schema
design, not of operator tuning.

### Awa-owned periodic VACUUM on `open_receipt_claims`

Rejected. A background `VACUUM` loop would mask the churn but keeps a hot
`DELETE` on the common completion path and leaves the table as a
permanent architectural outlier. The rest of the engine has no equivalent
self-vacuum loop.

### UPDATE-based soft close on `open_receipt_claims`

Rejected. Marking a `closed_at` column and sweeping closed rows
periodically keeps the table live-bounded, and a HOT-eligible `UPDATE`
avoids a new heap tuple. But the sweep still performs `DELETE`s in batch,
index bloat still tracks throughput, and the architectural outlier
persists.

### Ship 0.6 with receipts off

Rejected. Shipping with receipts off lets 0.6 hit the dead-tuple budget
today, but it leaves the short-job path on the mutable `leases` ring and
defers the work tracked in the archived
[`lease-plane-redesign-spike`](../archive/0.6-storage-design/lease-plane-redesign-spike.md).
ADR-019's vacuum-aware intent is only satisfied when receipts are on by
default and do not regress the dead-tuple budget. This ADR is the path to
that posture.

## Relationship to Earlier ADRs

- ADR-019 established the vacuum-aware discipline. This ADR applies that
  discipline to the one remaining hot table that did not follow it.
- ADR-013 (run-lease-guarded finalization) is unchanged. The
  authoritative record for `(job_id, run_lease)` staleness moves from a
  bounded mutable frontier to partitioned append-only tables; the
  guarantee does not.
- The archived
  [`lease-plane-redesign-spike`](../archive/0.6-storage-design/lease-plane-redesign-spike.md)
  identifies `open_receipt_claims` as the compromise that unblocked the
  receipt-backed path. This ADR is the follow-through that the spike
  anticipated.

## Implementation and Validation Status

This ADR has been implemented for 0.6:

- `lease_claims` and `lease_claim_closures` are partitioned by `claim_slot`.
- `claim_ring_state` and `claim_ring_slots` control rotation and prune.
- `open_receipt_claims` is removed from fresh installs and is no longer a hot
  path table.
- `lease_claim_receipts` defaults to `true`.
- Receipts mode supports per-claim deadlines. The claim path writes
  `deadline_at` onto the `lease_claims` row when
  `QueueConfig.deadline_duration > 0`, and a sibling rescue scan
  (`rescue_expired_receipt_deadlines_tx`) force-closes claims whose
  `deadline_at` has passed without a closure or materialized lease,
  writing a `'deadline_expired'` closure. The maintenance entry point
  (`rescue_expired_deadlines`) merges the lease-side and receipt-side
  scans into one batch per tick, so receipts mode and the existing
  hard-deadline behaviour compose without operator intervention.

Validation evidence is split by purpose:

- Runtime and long-horizon evidence lives in
  [`bench/023-receipt-ring-validation-2026-04-26.md`](bench/023-receipt-ring-validation-2026-04-26.md).
  The recorded runs include the 115-minute 4x8 receipts-on long-horizon run and
  the 12-hour overnight run; receipt closure partitions stayed at 0 dead tuples
  across every phase, and receipt claims remained bounded.
- Spec and implementation mapping lives in
  [`../../correctness/storage/MAPPING.md`](../../correctness/storage/MAPPING.md).
  The storage TLA+ family models claim-ring rotation, partition prune safety,
  receipt rescue, running cancel, and DLQ retry trace witnesses.
- Operator-facing tuning and defaults live in
  [`../configuration.md`](../configuration.md#queue-storage-tuning).

The detailed phase-by-phase implementation notes were intentionally kept out of
this ADR. ADRs record the decision and its consequences; dated build logs,
benchmark output, and branch-era investigation notes belong in validation
artifacts or the 0.6 storage-design archive.
