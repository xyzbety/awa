# Python Getting Started

This guide takes you from `pip install` to a job reaching `completed`.

## Mental Model

Before the code, here is the operational model Awa is built around:

- inserting a job writes a durable row to Postgres, so enqueueing can live inside the same transaction as your application write
- workers claim that row when it becomes runnable, heartbeat while it is executing, and rescue it if the worker dies
- retries, callback waits, and progress checkpoints are persisted back onto the job row instead of being held only in memory
- when you debug or operate the system, inspect the row first; the CLI and UI are designed around that read-only inspection path

That means “what happened?” is usually a database inspection question, not a worker-log archaeology exercise.

## Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL running locally or remotely
- Python 3.10+
- A database URL exported as `DATABASE_URL`

Example local URL:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:test@localhost:15432/awa_test
```

## 1. Install Packages

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install awa-pg
```

## 2. Run Migrations

```bash
python -m awa --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" migrate
```

## 3. Create a Worker

Create `quickstart.py`:

```python
import asyncio
import os
from dataclasses import dataclass

import awa

DATABASE_URL = os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]


@dataclass
class SendEmail:
    to: str
    subject: str


async def main() -> None:
    client = awa.AsyncClient(DATABASE_URL)

    @client.task(SendEmail, queue="email")
    async def handle_email(job):
        print(f"sending email to {job.args.to}: {job.args.subject}")

    await client.start([("email", 2)])

    job = await client.insert(
        SendEmail(to="alice@example.com", subject="Welcome"),
        queue="email",
    )

    await asyncio.sleep(1)

    result = await client.get_job(job.id)
    print(f"job {result.id} state = {result.state}")

    await client.shutdown()


asyncio.run(main())
```

## 4. Run It

```bash
python quickstart.py
```

Expected output is similar to:

```text
sending email to alice@example.com: Welcome
job 1 state = JobState.Completed
```

## 5. Inspect the Queue

```bash
python -m awa --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" job list --queue email
python -m awa --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" job dump 1
python -m awa --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" job dump-run 1
python -m awa --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" queue stats
```

`job dump` gives you the whole job snapshot as JSON. `job dump-run` focuses on one attempt: the current attempt uses live row data, while historical attempts are reconstructed from the stored `errors[]` history.

## 6. Web UI (optional)

The dashboard ships in a separate wheel so the default `awa-pg` install stays small for workers and producers. Install the `[ui]` extra to bring in the `awa-cli` binary that hosts it:

```bash
pip install 'awa-pg[ui]'
python -m awa --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" serve
# → http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

`python -m awa serve` delegates to the `awa serve` binary (you can also call `awa serve` directly once the extra is installed). The UI is read-only when the database reports `transaction_read_only = on` (e.g. on a replica) or when `--read-only` is passed.

## Useful Variants

- `await client.migrate()` runs migrations from Python instead of the CLI.
- `awa.Client` provides a synchronous API for Django or Flask — all methods are plain (e.g., `client.insert(...)`, `client.migrate()`, `client.transaction()`).
- `client.start()` accepts tuple queue configs for hard-reserved mode and dict configs for weighted mode. See [Configuration reference](configuration.md).

### Exporting OpenTelemetry metrics

awa records 20+ metrics (throughput, pickup latency, in-flight jobs, rescues, …) on the Rust side. Python workers enable OTLP export by calling `awa.init_telemetry(...)` once before the worker starts:

```python
import os
import awa

awa.init_telemetry(
    os.environ["OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT"],   # e.g. http://localhost:4317
    os.environ.get("OTEL_SERVICE_NAME", "my-service"),
)
# ... then build the client and start workers as normal.
```

`init_telemetry` is idempotent; only the first call installs a provider. Call `awa.shutdown_telemetry()` at the end of short-lived scripts to flush pending metrics. See [`awa-python/examples/telemetry.py`](../awa-python/examples/telemetry.py) for a runnable example.
