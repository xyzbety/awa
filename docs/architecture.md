# Awa Architecture Overview

Awa (Māori: river) is a Postgres-native background job queue for Rust and
Python. Postgres is the sole infrastructure dependency: there is no Redis,
RabbitMQ, sidecar scheduler, or separate lease store. Producers enqueue inside
ordinary Postgres transactions, workers claim and complete jobs through the
same database, and one elected worker runs cluster-wide maintenance.

This document is ordered by the questions operators and contributors usually
need answered first:

- What owns the runtime?
- What deployment assumptions shape that runtime?
- Where does state live?
- How does a job move through storage?
- How does Awa recover from crashes and stale attempts?
- How are partitions rotated and reclaimed?
- Which surfaces are operational rather than hot-path?

For migration details see [migrations.md](migrations.md). For user-facing
knobs see [configuration.md](configuration.md).

## Runtime Shape

The runtime is three cooperating layers:

| Layer | Owns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Application code | Producer transactions, Rust handlers, Python handlers, optional HTTP worker targets | Enqueue can commit or roll back with the application's own writes. Rust and Python workers share the same storage engine. |
| Worker runtime | Dispatchers, executor tasks, guarded completion, per-process heartbeat refresh, maintenance leader election | Every worker process runs these services. Only one process wins the maintenance lock at a time. |
| Postgres | Queue state, execution state, control metadata, uniqueness, cron rows, runtime snapshots | Postgres is the coordination point for visibility, claim ownership, recovery, callbacks, and operator state. |

The important ownership split is simple: every worker can dispatch and
heartbeat its own attempts, but exactly one elected maintenance leader runs
cluster-wide promotion, rescue, queue/lease/claim ring rotation and prune, DLQ
cleanup, descriptor cleanup, cron evaluation, metadata refresh, and
queue-health publication.

## Deployment Model

- Awa assumes one shared Postgres database and any number of Rust or Python
  worker processes.
- Each process registers the queues and job kinds it can execute.
- Queue work is awakened by `LISTEN/NOTIFY` with polling as the fallback.
- The maintenance leader is elected inside the same worker fleet; no `pg_cron`
  or external scheduler is required.
- Long analytical reads should run on replicas or with disciplined timeouts,
  because long-lived primary transactions can delay best-effort partition
  prune.

## Storage Planes

Queue storage is the worker engine in 0.6. It is not one mutable jobs heap; it
is split into queue, execution, and control planes so each plane carries the
right kind of churn.

| Plane | Tables | Shape | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| Queue | `ready_entries_*`, `done_entries_*` | Ring partitions by `ready_slot` | Runnable and terminal rows stay append-first and are reclaimed by queue-ring prune. |
| Queue backlog | `deferred_jobs` | Plain table | Scheduled and retryable work stays out of the hot claim path until promotion. |
| Operator hold | `dlq_entries` | Plain table | DLQ rows are explicit operator backlog with retry, purge, and retention cleanup. |
| Receipt execution | `lease_claims_*`, `lease_claim_closures_*` | Ring partitions by `claim_slot` | Short attempts avoid mutable lease rows; live receipts are claims anti-joined with closures. |
| Materialized execution | `leases_*`, `attempt_state` | Lease ring plus mutable state table | Attempts escalate here when they need callback waiting, progress, or other mutable attempt state. |
| Control | `queue_lanes`, heads, ring-state tables, `queue_meta`, descriptors, runtimes, cron, uniqueness | Narrow metadata tables | Claim cursors, queue state, operator metadata, uniqueness, and liveness are kept separate from payload history. |

The asymmetry is intentional. Ready/done, lease, and receipt tables are
ring-pruned because they are hot. Deferred and DLQ rows are backlog/hold tables
with their own promotion, retry, purge, and retention paths. Control tables
stay narrow because they are the coordination surface dispatchers and
maintenance touch most often.

ADR-019 is the storage-engine source of truth; ADR-023 supersedes it for the
receipt plane:

- [ADR-019: Queue Storage Engine](adr/019-queue-storage-redesign.md)
- [ADR-023: Receipt Plane Ring Partitioning](adr/023-receipt-plane-ring-partitioning.md)

## Job Lifecycle

Core transitions:

| From | To | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| insert | `available` | Immediate enqueue. |
| insert | `scheduled` | Future `run_at`. |
| `scheduled` / `retryable` | `available` | Maintenance promotion when `run_at <= now()`. |
| `available` | `running` | Dispatcher claim; `run_lease` increments. |
| `running` | `completed` | Handler succeeds. |
| `running` | `retryable` | Handler returns retryable failure or snooze/backoff path. |
| `running` | `waiting_external` | Handler parks for callback or sequential wait. |
| `waiting_external` | `running` | `resume_external` resumes a sequential wait. |
| `running` / `waiting_external` | `cancelled` | Handler cancel, admin cancel, or rescue cancellation. |
| `running` / `waiting_external` | `failed` | Attempts exhausted, terminal error, or callback timeout exhaustion. |
| `failed` | `dlq_entries` | Optional per-queue DLQ routing. |

`run_lease` increments at claim time. Runtime mutations carry
`(job_id, run_lease)`, so stale completions, retries, snoozes, cancels, and
callback resumes lose after rescue, admin cancellation, or re-claim.

Terminal rows differ by storage backend:

- In queue storage, `completed`, ordinary `failed`, and `cancelled` snapshots
  live in `done_entries_*` and are reclaimed by queue-ring prune.
- DLQ-enabled terminal failures are copied into `dlq_entries`; that table has
  explicit retention cleanup plus operator retry/purge.
- In the canonical compatibility path, terminal rows in `awa.jobs_hot` use
  row-by-row retention cleanup.

Progress is cleared on successful completion and preserved across retry,
snooze, cancel, fail, and rescue. Cancellation is cooperative for live
handlers: Rust handlers can poll `ctx.is_cancelled()`, Python handlers can poll
`job.is_cancelled()`, and stale storage writes are still rejected by the
`run_lease` guard if a handler misses the signal.

## Enqueue And Claim

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant P as Producer
    participant Q as Queue storage
    participant D as Dispatcher
    participant R as Ring state
    participant E as Executor

    P->>Q: insert / enqueue_many_copy inside app transaction
    Q->>Q: append ready_entries or deferred_jobs
    Q-->>D: NOTIFY awa:<queue>
    D->>D: pre-acquire local permits
    D->>Q: claim_runtime_batch_with_aging_for_instance
    Q->>Q: lock queue_claim_heads FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
    Q->>R: read lease and claim ring cursors
    Q->>Q: append receipt or materialize lease
    Q-->>D: claimed jobs + run_lease snapshots
    D->>E: execute handlers
```

Enqueue is transactional: if the producer's outer transaction rolls back, the
job never becomes visible. Immediate jobs append to `ready_entries_*`; future
scheduled or retryable jobs append to `deferred_jobs`; COPY ingestion uses the
same storage actions with larger batches.

Claim is cursor-based rather than heap-scan based:

- `queue_enqueue_heads` allocates lane sequence ranges at enqueue time.
- `queue_claim_heads` advances monotonically during claim and is the authority
  for the next claimable lane position.
- The dispatcher pre-acquires execution permits before claiming, so every
  claimed `running` job has reserved local capacity.
- Queue striping and bounded claimers reduce contention on very hot logical
  queues, but they do not own jobs. Recovery still follows the receipt/lease
  state in Postgres.

Priority ordering is by `(queue, priority, lane_seq)`. With queue storage,
priority aging is applied at claim time rather than by physically rewriting
ready rows.

## Completion And Callbacks

Handler results finalize through guarded storage transitions:

```text
handler result
    ├── Completed      -> close attempt, append done_entries(completed)
    ├── RetryAfter     -> close attempt, append deferred_jobs(retryable)
    ├── Snooze         -> close attempt, append deferred_jobs without attempt bump
    ├── Cancel         -> close attempt, append done_entries(cancelled)
    ├── Terminal error -> close attempt, append done_entries(failed) or dlq_entries
    └── Retryable err  -> close attempt, append deferred retry or terminal failure
```

Two callback modes share the same attempt guard:

- **Parked callback.** The handler registers a callback token and returns
  `WaitForCallback`; the runtime frees the task slot and moves the attempt to
  `waiting_external` until a signed callback completes, fails, retries, or
  resumes it.
- **Sequential wait.** The handler calls `wait_for_callback()` and stays
  suspended; `resume_external` writes the callback result and returns the same
  attempt to `running` so the handler can continue.

Callback tokens are attempt-specific. Stale tokens and stale completions are
rejected after a newer claim or terminal transition. The `awa-ui` HTTP callback
receiver verifies `X-Awa-Signature` when `AWA_CALLBACK_HMAC_SECRET` is set;
custom callback receivers must provide equivalent authentication.

## Recovery Model

Awa has three rescue paths:

- **Stale heartbeat rescue.** Each worker heartbeats the attempts it owns.
  The maintenance leader rescues attempts whose heartbeat is older than
  `heartbeat_staleness` (default 90s).
- **Hard deadline rescue.** Per-queue deadlines write `deadline_at` onto
  receipt or lease rows. The maintenance leader closes expired attempts and
  routes them through the normal retry/fail/DLQ path.
- **Callback-timeout rescue.** Waiting attempts with expired callback timeouts
  are moved back through the same guarded finalization machinery.

Rescue closes the old attempt before making work available again. If the old
handler later writes a completion, the `run_lease` guard rejects it as stale.
When rescue happens in a process that still has the handler registered, the
runtime also flips the in-memory cancellation flag.

## Partition Rotation And Reclamation

Queue storage has three independent rings, each advanced by the elected
maintenance leader:

| Ring | Partitions | Default cadence | Rotate requires | Prune requires |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Queue | `ready_entries_*`, `done_entries_*` | `1000ms` | incoming ready/done slot is empty | oldest non-current slot has no active leases and no pending ready rows |
| Lease | `leases_*` | `50ms` | incoming lease slot is empty | oldest initialized non-current lease slot is empty |
| Claim | `lease_claims_*`, `lease_claim_closures_*` | matches queue ring | incoming claims/closures slot is empty | every claim in the oldest non-current slot has a matching closure |

The maintenance tick for each ring is deliberately small: attempt one rotate,
then attempt one prune. If a partition is busy, blocked by a lock, current, or
still live, the tick records a skipped/blocked outcome and tries again on a
future interval.

The common safety pattern is:

1. Lock the ring-state row with `FOR UPDATE`.
2. Choose the incoming or oldest initialized slot.
3. Use a short `SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '50ms'` before child-table
   `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` locks in prune paths.
4. Recheck liveness after acquiring the partition lock.
5. `TRUNCATE` only partitions that are proven inactive.

This is why queue storage's hot-path reclamation is a rotation-and-prune
discipline, not ordinary row-by-row vacuum cleanup. Ordinary retention cleanup
still exists for DLQ rows, stale descriptors, stale runtime snapshots, and the
canonical compatibility path.

## Maintenance Leader

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Workers["Worker processes"]
        W1["worker"]
        W2["worker"]
        W3["worker"]
    end

    Lock["pg_try_advisory_lock(0x4157415f4d41494e)"]
    W1 --> Lock
    W2 --> Lock
    W3 --> Lock
    Lock -- "one session wins" --> Leader["maintenance leader"]
    Lock -- "retry later" --> Followers["followers"]

    Leader --> Tasks["promotion<br/>heartbeat/deadline/callback rescue<br/>queue/lease/claim rotate + prune<br/>DLQ cleanup<br/>descriptor cleanup<br/>cron eval<br/>metadata refresh<br/>queue health"]
```

The advisory lock is session-scoped. If the leader process or database
connection dies, Postgres releases the lock and another worker can win the next
election. Heartbeat refresh is not leader-elected; only cluster-wide rescue and
maintenance scans are.

## Operator Surfaces

### Descriptors And Runtime Liveness

Awa keeps operator-facing descriptor catalogs separate from per-job metadata:

- `awa.queue_descriptors` labels and documents queues.
- `awa.job_kind_descriptors` labels and documents job kinds.
- `awa.runtime_instances` reports live runtimes and descriptor hashes.

Descriptors are code-declared by Rust `ClientBuilder` or Python `AsyncClient`.
Workers upsert their declared descriptors at startup and on runtime snapshot
ticks. Admin APIs derive:

- **stale**: no live runtime has refreshed the descriptor recently.
- **drift**: live runtimes report conflicting descriptor hashes.

The maintenance leader deletes descriptor rows whose `last_seen_at` is older
than `descriptor_retention` (default 30 days). Runtime liveness rows are
garbage-collected on a shorter horizon.

### DLQ

The Dead Letter Queue is not a dispatchable `job_state`; it is a separate hold
table for failed snapshots that need operator action.

- DLQ policy is per queue.
- Retry deletes the DLQ row and inserts a fresh ready/deferred entry with
  `attempt = 0` and `run_lease = 0`.
- Purge deletes the DLQ row permanently.
- DLQ retention is independent of ordinary terminal history.

### Cron

Periodic jobs are declared by worker code and synchronized to `cron_jobs`.
Only the maintenance leader evaluates due schedules. Enqueue is atomic, so a
crash between evaluation and insert cannot create half-visible work.

## Observability And Correctness

Awa emits tracing spans and OpenTelemetry metrics for enqueue, claim,
execution, completion, rescue, rotation, prune, DLQ, queue depth, runtime
health, and callback flows. The Grafana dashboards in
[`docs/grafana`](grafana/README.md) use those metrics plus SQL panels for
storage-level inspection.

Core safety invariants are modeled in TLA+:

| Model | Focus |
|---|---|
| [`AwaCore`](../correctness/core/AwaCore.tla) | job lifecycle, retry/fail/cancel transitions, callback states |
| [`AwaBatcher`](../correctness/core/AwaBatcher.tla) | guarded completion batching and stale-result rejection |
| [`AwaSegmentedStorage`](../correctness/storage/AwaSegmentedStorage.tla) | queue-storage lifecycle, rotate/prune safety, DLQ round-trip, receipt rescue |
| [`AwaSegmentedStorageRaces`](../correctness/storage/AwaSegmentedStorageRaces.tla) | claim-vs-rotate/prune interleavings |
| [`AwaStorageLockOrder`](../correctness/storage/AwaStorageLockOrder.tla) | Postgres lock ordering across claim, rotate, and prune |
| [`AwaCbk`](../correctness/races/AwaCbk.tla) | callback registration/resume/finalization races |

The runtime tests replay representative storage traces against these models,
and the benchmark notes document long-horizon partition and dead-tuple
validation for ADR-019 and ADR-023.

├── awa-cli           migrations, admin, storage, and web UI CLI
└── awa-python        PyO3 Python bindings
```

`awa-model` owns schema and storage APIs. `awa-worker` owns runtime behavior.
`awa` is the normal Rust facade. `awa-python` embeds the same worker runtime
behind Python bindings, so mixed Rust/Python fleets share storage semantics.
