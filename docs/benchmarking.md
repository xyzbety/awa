# Benchmarking Notes

This document captures the benchmark harnesses used in the repo and a few
reference results from local runs and dedicated-server enqueue comparisons.

## Test Environment

- Local machine: Apple M5 MacBook Air (16 GB)
- Local runtime: PostgreSQL 17 in Docker (OrbStack)
- Local database URL used for the example commands:
  `postgres://postgres:test@localhost:15432/awa_test`
- Cross-system long-horizon comparisons run from a separate repo:
  [postgresql-job-queue-benchmarking](https://github.com/hardbyte/postgresql-job-queue-benchmarking).
  Default Postgres image is 17.2; `--pg-image postgres:18-alpine` selects PG18.
- Dedicated-server enqueue comparisons were also run against PostgreSQL 17 on
  a separate Linux host. Those numbers are used only for shape comparison and
  should not be treated as published throughput claims.
- Benchmarks live in:
  `awa/tests/benchmark_test.rs`
  `awa/tests/scheduling_benchmark_test.rs`
  `awa/tests/failure_benchmark_test.rs`
- Python worker benchmarks live in:
  `awa-python/scripts/benchmark_runtime.py`
- Shared output schema:
  `awa/tests/bench_output.rs` (Rust)
  `awa-python/scripts/bench_output.py` (Python)

These are local engineering benchmarks, not published vendor-style numbers. The
main goal is to compare shapes, validate architecture changes, and catch
regressions.

## Positioning Proof Checklist

Queue storage changes Awa's comparison set.

The interesting public question is no longer "can Postgres run jobs?" It is
"can a Postgres job queue keep dispatch latency low while also keeping hot-path
dead tuples bounded?"

That means the benchmark burden for positioning is different from the benchmark
burden for internal regressions. Before making the strongest public claim, the
comparison needs to be rerun cleanly on the same hardware against the right
reference points:

- Awa queue storage
- PgQue
- River
- optionally Oban Pro as a paid partitioned reference

The benchmark set should include:

- idle pickup latency
- sustained runtime throughput
- overlap readers / MVCC horizon pressure
- mixed workload soak
- terminal-failure burst

Operational differences should be called out, not hidden:

- Awa does not require `pg_cron`; the worker runtime owns dispatch, rescue,
  rotation, and prune.
- PgQue is designed around a periodic ticker and recommends `pg_cron`.
- River and Oban are job frameworks rather than shared-log event queues, so
  they remain the more comparable references for worker semantics.

Commands and raw output for any public-facing table should live in-repo under
`docs/adr/bench/` or another stable location so the resulting claim is
auditable.

## Methodology Notes

The most important lesson from this round of work is that benchmark isolation
matters.

The maintenance service is global to the worker instance. If a benchmark leaves
behind millions of deferred rows in `awa.scheduled_jobs`, later "hot path"
benchmarks may accidentally measure background promotion work as well. The
sustained hot/deferred benchmarks reset runtime state first to avoid that
pollution.

Two benchmark shapes are used:

- **Burst/frontier benchmarks**: seed a backlog, then drain it
- **Steady/sustained benchmarks**: warm up, then measure a fixed time window

Steady numbers are the better indicator of sustained runtime behavior.

## MVCC Horizon Benchmark

`awa/tests/scheduling_benchmark_test.rs` also includes an ignored
`test_mvcc_horizon_overlap_benchmark` scenario for the failure mode described in
PlanetScale's "Keeping a Postgres queue healthy" post: overlapping long-lived
transactions pin the MVCC horizon while queue churn continues.

The benchmark:

- runs a steady producer feeding `awa.jobs_hot`
- enables aggressive completed-job cleanup to generate update/delete churn
- starts overlapping `REPEATABLE READ` reader transactions on separate
  connections to hold old snapshots open
- samples per-second throughput, queue depth, and `pg_stat_user_tables`
  (`n_dead_tup`, vacuum counters) for `awa.jobs_hot`

Reader modes:

- `idle_snapshot`: pins a snapshot and waits inside the transaction; useful for
  the pure MVCC-horizon case
- `active_scan`: runs repeated queue scans inside the open transaction so the
  reader behaves more like overlapping analytics work on the primary

Example:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:test@localhost:15432/awa_test \
  cargo test --release --package awa --test scheduling_benchmark_test \
  test_mvcc_horizon_overlap_benchmark -- --ignored --exact --nocapture
```

This scenario is also wired into `.github/workflows/nightly-chaos.yml` and runs
on PostgreSQL 18 in the Rust nightly benchmark lane.

The nightly lane uses a shorter CI profile so the benchmark stays cheap on
shared runners while still exercising overlap readers and cleanup pressure:

- `AWA_MVCC_JOB_RATE=400`
- `AWA_MVCC_BASELINE_SECS=5`
- `AWA_MVCC_OVERLAP_SECS=12`
- `AWA_MVCC_COOLDOWN_SECS=5`
- `AWA_MVCC_OVERLAP_READERS=2`
- `AWA_MVCC_OVERLAP_HOLD_SECS=12`
- `AWA_MVCC_OVERLAP_STAGGER_SECS=4`
- `AWA_MVCC_READER_MODE=active_scan`
- `AWA_MVCC_ANALYTICS_TICK_MS=500`

Nightly regression checks use per-run ratios (`overlap_handler_per_s` and
`cooldown_handler_per_s` relative to the same run's baseline window) plus
guardrails on `dead_tup_delta` and `max_available`.

That nightly profile is intentionally short. It checks that Awa still behaves
reasonably under overlapping analytical readers, but it is not the same thing
as the 15-minute mixed-workload soak discussed in the PlanetScale post. For a
closer local reproduction, increase duration and reader hold times and keep the
readers in `active_scan` mode so queries overlap continuously rather than
simulating only `idle in transaction`.

A second ignored benchmark target now exists for that longer profile:
`test_mvcc_horizon_planetscale_soak`. Its default shape is closer to the blog's
mixed-workload setup:

- `800` jobs/sec producer rate
- `3` overlapping analytics readers
- `120s` reader hold time
- `20s` stagger between readers
- `15m` overlap window with `active_scan`

That soak benchmark is wired into CI as a weekly/manual run, while the shorter
`test_mvcc_horizon_overlap_benchmark` remains the daily nightly smoke.

### MVCC bench knobs

- `AWA_MVCC_JOB_RATE` — steady producer rate in jobs/sec
- `AWA_MVCC_BASELINE_SECS` / `AWA_MVCC_OVERLAP_SECS` / `AWA_MVCC_COOLDOWN_SECS`
- `AWA_MVCC_OVERLAP_READERS` / `AWA_MVCC_OVERLAP_HOLD_SECS` /
  `AWA_MVCC_OVERLAP_STAGGER_SECS`
- `AWA_MVCC_READER_MODE` — `idle_snapshot` or `active_scan`
- `AWA_MVCC_ANALYTICS_TICK_MS` — cadence for repeated analytics scans in
  `active_scan` mode
- `AWA_MVCC_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MS` / `AWA_MVCC_CLEANUP_BATCH_SIZE`

## Cross-system comparison

The awa benches in this file are the awa-only regression detection track —
fast, precise, hard thresholds, awa code only. They are not designed for
fair comparison with other systems.

For cross-system comparison, the long-horizon harness lives in a separate
repository so each system-under-test can be benchmarked through its public
API on equal footing:

[**hardbyte/postgresql-job-queue-benchmarking**](https://github.com/hardbyte/postgresql-job-queue-benchmarking)

The companion repo currently benchmarks awa against pgque, procrastinate,
pg-boss, river, oban, and pgmq using a shared subprocess contract: each
adapter is a self-contained binary that emits one JSON sample per line.
Headline numbers, per-system architectural notes, and reproducible run
instructions are in that repo's
[`SYSTEM_COMPARISONS.md`](https://github.com/hardbyte/postgresql-job-queue-benchmarking/blob/main/SYSTEM_COMPARISONS.md)
and [`results/2026-04-28/SUMMARY.md`](https://github.com/hardbyte/postgresql-job-queue-benchmarking/blob/main/results/2026-04-28/SUMMARY.md).

The two tracks are deliberately separate. If they ever diverge on
workload shape or thresholds, the awa-only benches in this file are
canonical for awa's own numbers and the cross-system runner defers.

### 2026-05-03 cross-system reference run

An overnight run of the companion benchmark repo compared `awa` 0.6 alpha
builds with the same phase-driven harness. Treat these as reference results for
shape and regression tracking, not universal product guarantees.

Key observations:

- `awa` peak throughput improved by `49%` from 0.6.0-alpha.2 to
  0.6.0-alpha.3 at 128 workers and one replica: `4,576` to `6,834` jobs/s.
  The same run showed a roughly `1.5x` to `1.7x` improvement across the
  worker-count matrix.
- Phase A matrix shape for `awa`: `296` -> `1,115` -> `3,961` -> `6,834`
  jobs/s as worker count increased.
- Phase B `pgmq` peaked at `13,290` jobs/s at 16 workers and collapsed at
  128 workers, matching the previously observed high-worker behaviour.
- Phase C multi-replica runs exposed the remaining `awa` topology sensitivity:
  at fixed total workers, throughput fell from `3,560` to `2,491` to `1,503`
  jobs/s across `1x64`, `2x32`, and `4x16`. That shape is consistent with
  fleet-wide completion flusher contention (`processes x AWA_COMPLETION_SHARDS`).
  `pgque` moved in the opposite direction in the same run (`18,660` ->
  `34,388` -> `38,810`), so this remains a useful comparison target rather
  than noise to smooth over.
- Phase D 60-minute `awa` soak sustained a median `5,369` jobs/s with median
  dead tuples around `396`, validating the ADR-019 / ADR-023 hot-path
  dead-tuple promise under sustained churn.

Follow-up tuning should focus on the multi-process completion path: either
attenuating default completion shards by fleet topology, coordinating flushers
more explicitly, or reducing the per-flush contention footprint further.

## Python Runtime Benchmarks

The Python benchmark script exercises the real `awa-python` worker path while
reusing the same database-facing benchmark shapes as the Rust runtime:

**Baseline scenarios** (`--scenario baseline`):

- `copy`: Python client `insert_many_copy` throughput
- `hot`: sustained worker throughput over pre-seeded `awa.jobs_hot`
- `scheduled`: sustained deferred promotion over pre-seeded `awa.scheduled_jobs`

**Failure scenarios** (`--scenario failures`):

- `terminal_1pct` / `10pct` / `50pct`: terminal failures
- `retryable_1pct` / `10pct` / `50pct`: retry-once failures
- `callback_timeout_10pct`: callback registration with short timeout
- `mixed_50pct`: rotating through terminal, retryable, and success modes

The worker-focused scenarios seed with SQL directly so the reported number is
about Python handler dispatch and runtime behavior, not enqueue serialization.

## Reference Results

### Immediate Enqueue Throughput

The enqueue path that is being measured here has a few important architectural
properties:

- homogeneous inserts now route directly to `awa.jobs_hot` or
  `awa.scheduled_jobs` instead of going through the compatibility view
- admin metadata maintenance moved from row-level triggers to statement-level
  trigger batches
- COPY staging now reuses a session-local temp table and stages typed values
  instead of reparsing text on the final `INSERT ... SELECT`

Example reference results from one local laptop run and one dedicated server
run:

- local laptop (`Apple M5`, release build, v0.5.0-alpha.0):
  - `insert_only_single`: about `30k inserts/s`
  - `copy_single`: about `43k inserts/s`
  - `insert_contention_distinct` (4 producers x 3k): about `46k inserts/s`
  - `copy_contention_distinct` (4 producers x 3k, chunk 1000): about `100k inserts/s`
  - `insert_contention_same_queue` (4 producers x 3k): about `95k inserts/s`
  - `copy_contention_same_queue` (4 producers x 3k, chunk 1000): about `67k inserts/s`

These are engineering comparisons, not product guarantees. Their main value is
showing where the architecture bottlenecks move as the implementation changes.

### Sustained Hot Path

Measured with `test_runtime_sustained_hot_path` after resetting runtime state:

- warmup: 2s
- measurement window: 10s
- queue size seeded: 200,000 immediately-available jobs

Example reference result from one local run (release mode, v0.5.0-alpha.0):

- handler returns: about `5.6k jobs/s`
- DB `completed` transitions: about `5.6k jobs/s`

This benchmark enables the in-memory OpenTelemetry exporter and the
production alerting metrics path (queue depth, lag, wait-duration histogram).
Back-to-back A/B testing shows v0.5.0 is ~44% faster than v0.4.1 on the
same hardware (5.9k vs 4.1k/s) — the promotion query optimizations more
than offset the metrics instrumentation cost.

### Python Runtime Baseline

Measured with `awa-python/scripts/benchmark_runtime.py` on the same local
database:

- `insert_many_copy`: about `16.2k jobs/s` (`50,000` jobs in `3.09s`)
- sustained hot path:
  - handler returns: about `3.2k jobs/s`
  - DB `completed` transitions: about `3.1k jobs/s`

These runs isolate the Python worker path. Seed data is inserted with SQL so
the runtime number is not dominated by Python-side enqueue serialization.

### Large Deferred Frontier

Measured with `test_scheduled_steady_10m_due_1k_per_sec`:

- total deferred backlog: `10,000,000` rows
- due rate target: `1,000` jobs/s
- measurement window: 10s

Isolated 4-thread Tokio runtime result (release mode, v0.5.0-alpha.0):

- `9,000` of `10,000` due jobs completed within the window
- per-second completions: `0, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000`
  — perfectly steady after the first-tick startup delay
- pickup lateness:
  - `p50`: `229 ms`
  - `p95`: `332 ms`
  - `p99`: `343 ms`
- promotion: `354` batches, mean `4.3 ms`, max `59 ms`
- claim latency: mean `5.0 ms`

This demonstrates that the hot/deferred split with literal-state promotion
queries handles a 10M-row deferred frontier with steady, predictable throughput.

**Key optimization (v0.5.0):** Promotion queries use literal state values
(e.g., `WHERE state = 'scheduled'`) instead of parameterized (`WHERE state = $1`).
This allows the Postgres planner to match the partial index
`idx_awa_scheduled_jobs_run_at_scheduled` at plan time. With a parameterized
query, the planner falls back to a full bitmap scan on multi-million-row tables,
degrading promotion from ~4ms to ~400ms per batch (100x slower).

### Moderate Deferred Frontier — Higher Due Rate

Measured with `test_scheduled_steady_2m_due_4k_per_sec`:

- total deferred backlog: `2,000,000` rows
- due rate target: `4,000` jobs/s
- measurement window: 10s

Result (v0.5.0-alpha.0):

- all `40,000` due jobs were picked and completed
- pickup lateness: `p50`: `0 ms`, `p95`: `0 ms`, `p99`: `57 ms`
- promotion: `214` batches, mean `10.0 ms`, max `176 ms`
- claim latency: mean `12.4 ms`

This validates the architecture at a realistic production scale: 2M deferred
rows with 4k/s throughput and reliable promotion.

### High-Rate Deferred Frontier: 10M at 6k/s

Measured with `test_scheduled_steady_10m_due_6k_per_sec`:

- total deferred backlog: `10,000,000` rows
- due rate target: `6,000` jobs/s
- measurement window: 10s

Result:

- `58,686` of `60,000` target jobs completed within the window (98%)
- per-second completions: `2942, 6834, 6907, 4758, 5915, 5662, 7246, 6446, 5305, 6671`
- pickup lateness: `p50`: `0 ms`, `p95`: `310 ms`, `p99`: `476 ms`
- promotion: `242` batches, mean `6.4 ms`, max `99 ms`

This rate was previously a documented scaling limit (only 20-57k of 60k
promoted, promotion at 1.7-3.6s per batch). The literal-state promotion
fix (v0.5.0) eliminated the bottleneck entirely.

**Key tuning parameters for promotion throughput:**

- `PROMOTE_BATCH_SIZE` (default `4,096`): rows per promotion batch
- `PROMOTE_MAX_BATCHES_PER_TICK` (default `32`): max batches per maintenance tick
- `promote_interval` (default `250 ms`): how often promotion runs
- `COMPLETION_FLUSH_INTERVAL` (default `1 ms`): completion batcher flush interval
- `AWA_COMPLETION_BATCH_SIZE` (default `128`): max rows per completion-batcher
  flush. Lowered from `512` after multi-replica matrix runs showed `128`
  delivered the lowest p99 across the 1–4 worker-process band; `512` did
  not buy throughput and worsened tail latency.
- `AWA_COMPLETION_SHARDS`: number of parallel completion flushers. The
  runtime default is storage-dependent: `8` for canonical storage and `4`
  for queue storage. The effective fleet-wide flusher count is
  `processes × AWA_COMPLETION_SHARDS`, so tune accordingly for
  multi-process deployments in either storage mode.

### Concurrent Multi-Queue Lifecycle

Measured with `concurrent_lifecycle_test.rs`. Four queues (`email:32`,
`payments:16`, `analytics:64`, `webhooks:16` workers), 128 total workers,
full insert → claim → execute → complete lifecycle.

Queue-count sweep with 128 total workers, pool=50, 20k jobs (release mode):

| Config | Workers/queue | Throughput | Per-worker |
|--------|--------------|------------|------------|
| 1 queue × 128 | 128 | `~1.9k/s` | `~14/s` |
| 2 queues × 64 | 64 | `~2.0k/s` | `~15/s` |
| 4 queues × 32 | 32 | `~350/s` | `~2.7/s` |

**Key finding**: 1-queue and 2-queue throughput is essentially identical,
but 4 queues drops 5-6x. The cliff between 2 and 4 queues indicates
that the per-queue dispatcher overhead (separate claim query, PgListener,
semaphore) compounds non-linearly when many small queues share a pool.

For comparison, the hot-path benchmark (200k pre-seeded into `jobs_hot`
via SQL) reaches `~10k/s` because it bypasses insert triggers and has a
fully warmed dispatch pipeline. The lifecycle benchmarks exercise the
complete path including job-state triggers and notification.

**Tuning guidelines**:

- Size the connection pool to at least `num_queues * 4 + 20`. With
  4 queues, that's 36+ connections.
- Prefer fewer queues with larger worker pools over many small queues.
  2 queues × 64 workers performs the same as 1 × 128.
- Use multi-queue for isolation, priority, or rate limiting — not for
  throughput.

A unified cross-queue claim query (one SQL round-trip claiming across all
queues via `LATERAL JOIN`) could eliminate the per-queue dispatch overhead.
Prototyping shows 16ms for 48 jobs across 2 queues — comparable to
single-queue performance. This is tracked as a future optimization.

### Progress Feature Overhead

The structured progress feature (ADR-014) adds a `progress JSONB` column
and a two-tier heartbeat flush. Performance impact was validated:

- **Zero overhead when no progress is set.** The heartbeat service
  partitions jobs by pending progress — jobs without mutations use the
  original heartbeat-only query. `snapshot_pending_progress` returns empty
  when no generation has been bumped.
- **Completion batcher** adds `progress = NULL` to the batch UPDATE. This
  is a constant-time write to a nullable column with no measurable impact
  (batcher throughput remains ~78k/s in unit benchmarks).
- **Sustained hot-path throughput** was unchanged when the progress feature
  was added. Current hot-path throughput (~5.6k/s) reflects the additional
  v0.5.0 OTel metrics instrumentation, not progress overhead.

## Failure-Mode Benchmarks

The failure-mode benchmark suite measures throughput, drain time, and recovery
behaviour when a configurable percentage of jobs fail, retry, hang, or trigger
rescue paths. This answers a question the happy-path benchmarks cannot: **how
does failure impact healthy-job throughput?**

### Benchmark matrix

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `terminal_1pct` / `10pct` / `50pct` | N% of jobs fail terminally |
| `retryable_1pct` / `10pct` / `50pct` | N% of jobs fail once then succeed on retry |
| `callback_timeout_10pct` | 10% register a callback that times out, then succeed on retry |
| `deadline_hang_10pct` | 10% hang until deadline rescue fires, then succeed on retry |
| `snooze_once_10pct` | 10% snooze once, then succeed |
| `mixed_all_modes` | 50% success, 10% each of terminal/retryable/callback/deadline/snooze |
| `stale_heartbeat_rescue` | All jobs seeded as "running" with stale heartbeat — measures rescue-to-completion time |

### Rust harness

Tests live in `awa/tests/failure_benchmark_test.rs`. Each scenario seeds jobs
deterministically by mode, starts a Client with aggressive rescue intervals,
drains to terminal states, and emits both human-readable output and a JSONL
record. The full matrix command covers the 10 failure scenarios; the
stale-heartbeat rescue benchmark is a separate test.

### Python harness

The Python benchmark (`awa-python/scripts/benchmark_runtime.py`) supports a
failure-mode subset via `--scenario failures`:

- `terminal_1pct` / `10pct` / `50pct`
- `retryable_1pct` / `10pct` / `50pct`
- `callback_timeout_10pct`
- `mixed_50pct`

It does not yet include the Rust-only `deadline_hang`, `snooze_once`, or
`stale_heartbeat_rescue` scenarios. The worker returns `RetryAfter`,
`WaitForCallback`, `Cancel`, or raises exceptions based on the job's `mode`
field.

### Structured output

Both Rust and Python benchmarks emit one JSONL record per scenario, prefixed
with `@@BENCH_JSON@@` for extraction. Schema version 2:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "scenario": "terminal_10pct",
  "language": "rust",
  "seeded": 5000,
  "metrics": {
    "throughput": {
      "handler_per_s": 4200.0,
      "db_finalized_per_s": 4100.0
    },
    "drain_time_s": 1.22,
    "rescue": {
      "deadline_rescued": 0,
      "callback_timeouts": 0
    }
  },
  "outcomes": {
    "completed": 4500,
    "failed": 500
  }
}
```

Extract JSONL from mixed stdout: `grep '@@BENCH_JSON@@' output.txt | sed 's/^@@BENCH_JSON@@//'`

For enqueue-only benchmarks (`insert_only_single`, `copy_single`, and the
contention matrix), `metrics.enqueue_per_s` is emitted instead of
`metrics.throughput`. Those records still include `"measurement": "enqueue"` in
`metadata`, plus optional Postgres-side deltas such as `wal_bytes`,
`temp_bytes_delta`, and `xact_commit_delta`.

## Interpreting The Results

Some practical guidelines:

- Compare like with like. Burst/frontier benchmarks and steady-state benchmarks
  answer different questions.
- Reset runtime state before sustained measurements if you want to isolate one
  path. Global background work can distort results.
- Prefer the `db_completed_delta` view when you care about end-to-end queue
  completion, not just handler return rate.
- Treat the numbers here as machine-local reference points, not portable
  guarantees.

## How To Run

### Happy-path benchmarks

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:test@localhost:15432/awa_test \
  cargo test --package awa --test scheduling_benchmark_test \
  test_runtime_sustained_hot_path -- --exact --ignored --nocapture

DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:test@localhost:15432/awa_test \
  cargo test --package awa --test scheduling_benchmark_test \
  test_scheduled_steady_2m_due_4k_per_sec -- --exact --ignored --nocapture
```

### Enqueue contention benchmarks

These are the most useful benchmarks when you want to compare single-producer
enqueue against multi-producer contention, or compare chunked `INSERT` with the
COPY staging path under concurrent writers.

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:test@localhost:15432/awa_test \
  AWA_BENCH_CONTENTION_PRODUCERS=4 \
  AWA_BENCH_CONTENTION_JOBS_PER_PRODUCER=3000 \
  AWA_BENCH_INSERT_BATCH_SIZE=1000 \
  AWA_BENCH_COPY_CHUNK_SIZE=1000 \
  cargo test --package awa --test benchmark_test \
  test_enqueue_contention_matrix -- --exact --ignored --nocapture
```

This emits six JSONL records:

- `insert_single`
- `copy_single`
- `insert_contention_distinct`
- `copy_contention_distinct`
- `insert_contention_same_queue`
- `copy_contention_same_queue`

The matrix hard-resets Awa runtime tables before each scenario so later cases
do not inherit a larger or dirtier jobs table from earlier ones.

By default, `AWA_BENCH_COPY_CHUNK_SIZE` should match
`AWA_BENCH_INSERT_BATCH_SIZE` if you want the closest apples-to-apples
comparison between chunked `INSERT` and chunked COPY staging. If you want to
test the current "one bulk COPY per producer" shape instead, set
`AWA_BENCH_COPY_CHUNK_SIZE` to `AWA_BENCH_CONTENTION_JOBS_PER_PRODUCER`.

The optional Postgres profile block in `metadata.db_profile` is meant to make
server runs easier to interpret. In particular:

- `wal_bytes` shows how much WAL the scenario generated
- `temp_bytes_delta` and `temp_files_delta` show temp-file pressure
- `xact_commit_delta` helps explain why many small commits degrade throughput
- `tup_inserted_delta` shows how much table churn the database observed

```

## Caveats

- These numbers are from one local machine and one local Postgres setup.
- Ignored benchmark tests are not part of the normal unit/integration test pass.
- The current focus is relative behavior and architectural validation, not
  cross-machine leaderboard comparisons.

## Cross-system numbers

Cross-system comparison (awa vs pgque / procrastinate / pg-boss / river /
oban / pgmq) lives in
[hardbyte/postgresql-job-queue-benchmarking](https://github.com/hardbyte/postgresql-job-queue-benchmarking).
That repo is the source of truth for fair-comparison numbers, chaos
results across systems, and the long-horizon harness itself.

The reasoning for the split: cross-system benches need to evolve at the
pace of the systems being compared (each gets new releases, new public
APIs, new adapter caveats), and the awa-only regression track in this
file needs to evolve at awa's pace. Keeping them in one repo coupled
their schedules and conflated "did awa regress?" with "is awa still
faster than X?". They're separate questions; they're now in separate
places.
