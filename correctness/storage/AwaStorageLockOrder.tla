---- MODULE AwaStorageLockOrder ----
EXTENDS TLC, Naturals, FiniteSets, Sequences

\* Lock-ordering protocol spec for the queue-storage engine.
\*
\* The data-level specs (AwaSegmentedStorage, AwaSegmentedStorageRaces)
\* deliberately abstract away from Postgres locks. This spec models the
\* SQL locks directly so a future refactor that weakens or re-orders
\* them trips an invariant.
\*
\* The claim/rotate/prune race against the lease ring is mitigated by:
\*   - the rotators taking FOR UPDATE on lease_ring_state and the
\*     target slot row (so two rotators serialise),
\*   - LOCK TABLE ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on the partition child (so prune
\*     waits for in-flight claim/complete writes to commit before
\*     truncating).
\* Note: the claim CTE reads lease_ring_state with a plain SELECT, NOT
\* a FOR SHARE. The conflict detection between claim and rotate is the
\* rotator's CAS UPDATE (`WHERE current_slot=$ AND generation=$`) plus
\* the rotator's empty-partition busy-check, not a row-level lock.
\* The plans below treat the ring-state read as a no-lock step (it is
\* simply elided from the plan).
\*
\* ADR-023 extends the locked resources with the claim ring
\* (claim_ring_state, claim_ring_slots, lease_claims child partitions,
\* lease_claim_closures child partitions) and the parallel rotate/prune
\* plans for the claim ring. The claim path takes a RowExclusive on
\* the lease_claims child partition (receipts mode) or the leases child
\* partition (legacy mode). Closure writes on terminal transitions take
\* a RowExclusive on the lease_claim_closures child partition matching
\* the originating claim.
\*
\* What it models:
\* - each transaction as an ordered sequence of (resource, mode) lock
\*   acquisitions
\* - simplified lock mode compatibility: shared (S) vs exclusive (X)
\*   (S/S is compatible; everything else conflicts)
\* - blocking: a tx that wants a lock incompatible with one held by
\*   another tx enters a "waiting" state and records what it is waiting
\*   for
\* - commit: an unblocked tx that has acquired all its locks releases
\*   them and terminates
\*
\* What it checks:
\* - NoDeadlock: the waits-for graph is acyclic
\* - LockCompatibility: no two incompatible locks are held on the same
\*   resource at the same time
\* - HeldOnlyByAliveTxs: committed/aborted txs hold no locks
\*
\* What it intentionally does not model:
\* - MVCC / snapshot isolation — we only care about lock-order safety
\* - the actual data under the locks — AwaSegmentedStorage covers that
\* - Postgres's lock_timeout or deadlock detector abort choice — we
\*   flag cycles as safety violations so the spec fails fast rather
\*   than modelling the race-to-abort
\* - implicit table-level locks beyond what is explicitly named in each
\*   plan; we treat each named resource as the lock unit

CONSTANTS TxIds,

\* Lock modes. We collapse the Postgres matrix to S/X.
\*
\* `ModeShared` covers everything in Postgres that allows other writers
\* to proceed concurrently: AccessShare (plain SELECT), RowShare (SELECT
\* FOR UPDATE / FOR SHARE), and RowExclusive (INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE).
\* These all share with each other at the table level — two concurrent
\* INSERTs to the same partition do not deadlock at the table level.
\* Row-level FOR UPDATE conflicts on the same row are deliberately
\* abstracted away; the spec models partition-level locking, not
\* row-level. Conflicts that fall through that abstraction (e.g. two
\* admin cancels of the same job) serialise via row locks the spec
\* doesn't track, and they can't deadlock with anything else because
\* they're per-row.
\*
\* `ModeExclusive` covers AccessExclusive (LOCK TABLE / TRUNCATE) and
\* the FOR UPDATE on singleton rows like `lease_ring_state`. For a
\* singleton row, "FOR UPDATE" really IS exclusive at the abstraction
\* level — only one tx at a time gets to advance the cursor.
\*
\* The compatibility check therefore is: S/S allowed, S/X and X/X both
\* conflict.
ModeShared == "S"
ModeExclusive == "X"
Modes == {ModeShared, ModeExclusive}

Compatible(held, wanted) == held = ModeShared /\ wanted = ModeShared

\* Resource identities. We model each parameterised resource as a record
\* so its identity is uniquely carried by its parameters.

\* A plan step is [res, mode].
Step(res, mode) == [res |-> res, mode |-> mode]

\* A small, explicit two-stripe shape for the hot logical queue case.
\* `StripeA` / `StripeB` are physical queue names such as `queue#0`
\* and `queue#1`. The enqueue path processes grouped physical queues
\* in a stable order inside one transaction. Runtime claim used to
\* visit multiple physical stripes inside one claim transaction; the
\* Rust implementation now claims each physical stripe in its own
\* transaction, so the main spec only starts single-stripe claim plans.

\* Transaction kind plans. Each mirrors the actual SQL in
\* awa-model/src/queue_storage.rs as noted inline.

\* insert_ready_rows_tx / insert_ready_rows_copy_tx
\*   UPDATE queue_enqueue_heads for each grouped physical queue
\*   INSERT / COPY ready rows
\*   UPDATE queue_lanes for each grouped physical queue
\*
\* The model collapses the queue_enqueue_heads and queue_lanes rows
\* into LaneResource, because the deadlock class we care about is
\* multi-stripe transactions taking lane-family locks in different
\* physical-queue orders. Enqueue keeps a stable physical-stripe order.
EnqueueTwoStripePlan(p) ==
    << Step(LaneResource(StripeA, p), ModeExclusive),

\* The claim CTE
\* (`claim_runtime_batch_with_aging_for_instance` in queue_storage.rs)
\*   FOR UPDATE OF queue_claim_heads SKIP LOCKED (per-(queue,priority) row)
\*   plain SELECT of lease_ring_state and claim_ring_state — no
\*     FOR SHARE / FOR UPDATE; serialisation against rotate is via
\*     the rotator's CAS UPDATE on (current_slot, generation), not a
\*     row lock here, so these reads are NOT modelled as plan steps.
\*   plain SELECT of ready_entries_<slot> (implicit AccessShare on child)
\*   INSERT INTO lease_claims_<claim_slot> (receipts mode) OR
\*   INSERT INTO leases_<lease_slot> (legacy mode)
\*   UPDATE queue_claim_heads (already locked, no new acquire)
\*
\* Two distinct plans because the receipts and legacy modes write to
\* different children. `experimental_lease_claim_receipts` selects
\* between them at runtime.
\* RowExclusive on partition children (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/SELECT FOR
\* UPDATE) is `ModeShared` in this spec — see the lock-mode comment
\* above. The lane row uses `ModeExclusive` because `FOR UPDATE OF
\* queue_claim_heads` on the same lane row really does serialise.

\* Historical unsafe logical-queue claim shape: one transaction walked
\* multiple physical stripes starting at a rotating probe point. This
\* can invert the stable enqueue order and form a waits-for cycle:
\* enqueue holds StripeA then wants StripeB while claim holds StripeB
\* then wants StripeA. The production path no longer uses this shape;
\* it remains in the spec only as a negative regression harness.
